When we in the specific item type then we can see 5 items show at the page one.  
We can use the function at page bottom to change the page, like next or Previous, or type the page number you want to go and then click go.    
We also can click one item to see the detail information of it, even do some interaction like borrow, return, consume with this item (After we log in those function become available).
